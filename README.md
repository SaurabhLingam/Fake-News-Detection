This is a ML project that works on 4 ML models 
1) Logistical Regression
2) Decision Tree Classifier
3) Gradient Boosting Classifier
4) Random Forest Classifier

How it works: 
These 4 models are trained on TF-IDF vectors, by using multiple models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.), you can combine predictions and average them (as shown in your code). This is known as an ensemble approach, where different models vote or make predictions together. The final decision is often more accurate because the strengths of each model compensate for the weaknesses of the others.
